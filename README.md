### Reflections ###

- Having completed an intro to PHP course, I created this project to practice using the basics of PHP. I've found PHP to be syntactically similar to Javascript so the learning curve hasn't been too steep. Most in-built methods are similar to those of JavaScript and Ruby.  This particular project only uses methods and doesn't include any classes. That may be something to include in a future refactoring but for now it meets basic requirements. 

### Next steps ###
- Testing
- Refactoring for a game class?
- Possible incorporation of HTML to play on a webpage.
